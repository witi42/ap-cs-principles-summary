The curriculum is an all-in-one turnkey solution with built-in instructional videos, auto-graded practice exams, a teacher dashboard, and Create Task preparation resources. Teachers receive a self-paced online PD course and year-long professional learning community access. *(Hello World continues to support existing implementations but is not onboarding new schools as of 2024.)*                                                                                              |
| **Barobo – CSP with Robotics**                            | Free (for qualified teachers; hardware optional)             | Block-based coding (Roboblockly); CSP pseudocode                                          | **Niche** (targets robotics-focused programs; used in some STEM academies, especially in California).                                            | Integrates **robotics** into AP CSP by using Barobo’s virtual and hardware robots to engage students. Students program a virtual robot through a block-based interface (or optional hardware robots) and can see their code control robot movements in real time. Uniquely, the platform allows coding in both block mode and AP CSP pseudocode side-by-side, giving students interactive practice with the exam’s pseudocode standards. This dual-mode approach helps solidify programming concepts and prepares students for the AP exam format. Barobo’s LMS environment includes built-in robot simulations and a full CSP curriculum developed with UC Davis C-STEM. Curriculum and PD are **free** for educators (with an application). Teacher training workshops (in-person/online) and follow-up sessions throughout the year ensure successful implementation.   |
