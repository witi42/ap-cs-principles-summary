can you create two scripts:
- generate_pdf.sh
- generate_html.sh

In contrast to the existing generate.sh script, I will run the new scripts form the full-summary directory, not from the root directory.

-----------
We need to extend the lists section
- Explain the operations
- Explain how indexing starts with 1 instead of 0 like in most programming languages
    - show a visual list with the indexes below the list elements
- Iteration with FOR EACH _ IN _
- list operations (APPEND(list, value), REMOVE(list, index), INSERT(aList, i, value))

- Comparison table: AP CSP vs JavaScript vs Python
    - assignment
    - relational operators
    - functions vs procedures
    - lists indexing (starting with 1 vs starting with 0)
    - list operations (append, remove, etc)

-----------
Improved the code examples. When it makes sense, show another box (different background color) below the code example to show "Output" of the code example. If too redundant, remove the comment then, if not, keep it.

Remove the AI Assisted disclaimer from the summary
